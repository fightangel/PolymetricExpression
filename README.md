Using The Library
====================
<ol>
	<li>
      <p>The easiest way</p>
      <p>Files needed: pe-lib/*, sample-manager.js, player-facade.js</p>
      <p>
      	player-facade.js provides an easy way to play polymetric expression, assuming you want to use sample-manager.js to load the samples.
      	<br/>
      	There are 4 steps:</p>
      <ol>
      	<li>
      		Create a playerFacade object
      	</li>
      	<li>
      		Call playerFacade.loadSamples to load the samples
      		<p>
      			The sampleUrl is the url of the folder the sample files located in. The folder should contains a mapping.js file. 
         		<br/>
         		Look at "acoustic-kit" folder for an example of the structure.
         	</p>
      	</li>
      	<li>
      		Call playerFacade.play with the expression you want to play
      	</li>
      	<li>
      		(Optional) Call playerFacade.stop when you want to stop
      	</li>
      </ol>
      The playerFacade class also exports other things like the player it uses to provide more detailed control. Look at the code for more information.
   </li>
   <li>
      <p>Need more control</p>
      <p>Files needed: pe-lib/*</p>
      
      <p>
      	If you need more control, you can use pe-player.js directly but this way is a bit more complicated. Look at pe-player.js for more information.
      	<br/>
      	You can use demo.js as an example.
      </p>
   </li>
</ol>
